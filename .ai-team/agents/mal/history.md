## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->


### 2026-02-10: Architecture Overview & Codebase Map (summarized)

CakePHP 5.x app with Docker (PHP/Apache, MariaDB 11, Mailpit). Frontend: Stimulus.JS + Turbo Frames (Drive disabled) + Bootstrap 5.3.6 via Laravel Mix. Plugin ecosystem: 6 active (Activities, Officers, Awards, Waivers, Queue, GitHubIssueSubmitter) + 2 inactive. Registration: `config/plugins.php` → `KMPPluginInterface` → `bootstrap()` → registries. Core DI: AWM (no txn) → WM (owns txn) → OfficerManager. 37 policies, all extend BasePolicy. Dangerous to change: BaseEntity/BaseTable hierarchy, PermissionsLoader, ServiceResult pattern, static registries, middleware order, ActiveWindowBehavior, transaction ownership, window.Controllers pattern.

### 2026-02-10: Test Infrastructure & Queue Review (summarized)

**Test plan:** 6-phase plan. Phase 1-2 done (suites runnable, state leakage fixed). Auth strategy: standardize TestAuthenticationHelper, gap in `authenticateAsSuperUser()` not setting permissions. Queue plugin: decided to own it, security concerns (ExecuteTask removed), 47 source files trimmed.

### 2026-02-10: Documentation Modernization (summarized)

8 tasks completed: Waivers full rewrite, Awards data model phantom fields removed, migration orders corrected, OfficerManagerInterface param count fixed, RecommendationsTablePolicy code corrected, cross-reference rot cleaned, section numbering fixed.

### 2026-02-10: Workflow Engine Architecture Review (summarized)

Graph-based execution engine with 9 node types, 4 static registries (`WorkflowTriggerRegistry`, `WorkflowActionRegistry`, `WorkflowConditionRegistry`, `WorkflowEntityRegistry`), plugin extension via `KMPWorkflowPluginInterface`. Versioning: draft→published→archived. Approval gates: 5 approver strategies. Key concerns: DI bypassed (P1), no txn wrapping, dual-path business logic, zero tests, synchronous execution, `resolveValue()` copy-pasted 4x. Engine core: `DefaultWorkflowEngine.php` (~1,100 lines). Full reviews consolidated into decisions.md.

📌 Team updates (2026-02-10): All 4 agents reviewed codebase, workflow engine, and docs. Auth triage complete (370→463 tests). Queue plugin owned. Roster sync designed and implemented by Kaylee.

### 2026-02-11: Action Schema & Context Mapping Architecture

#### Key Findings
- **Action/trigger schemas are already structured** — `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` in providers already use `['type' => '...', 'label' => '...', 'required' => true]` format. The data is there; the frontend doesn't use it.
- **Variable picker has a trigger bug** — `WorkflowVariablePicker.getNodeOutputSchema()` looks for `trigger.outputSchema` but triggers register `payloadSchema`. Falls through to generic fallback.
- **Variable picker has an action path bug** — Generates `$.nodes.{nodeId}.{key}` but engine stores at `$.nodes.{nodeId}.result.{key}` (see `DefaultWorkflowEngine` line 641).
- **Config panel doesn't render action inputs** — `_actionHTML()` in `workflow-config-panel.js` only shows the action dropdown. No form fields for the action's `inputSchema` params.
- **Trigger `inputMapping` determines `$.trigger.*` keys** — The trigger node's `config.inputMapping` maps event fields into context. The variable picker ignores this and tries raw payload keys.
- **Approval resume data structure** — When approval resolves, `WorkflowsController` line 398-403 passes `{approval, approverId, decision, comment}` as `additionalData` to `resumeWorkflow()`, which stores it at `$context['resumeData']`.
- **Engine merges `config.params` into flat config** — `DefaultWorkflowEngine::executeActionNode()` line 634-636 merges `config.params` into `config` before calling the action. This means param nesting is intentional.

#### Architecture Decision
- Schema format stays the same — no migration needed. Add optional `description`, `default` fields.
- Context accumulation happens client-side (graph + registry data already available).
- Config panel enhanced to render `inputSchema` fields with variable picker per field.
- 5 phases: fix variable picker bugs → action input rendering → approval schema → publish validation → enrichment.
- No new PHP endpoints for Phase 1-2. Phase 3 adds approval/builtin schemas to existing `/workflows/registry`.

#### Key File Paths
- `app/assets/js/controllers/workflow-variable-picker.js` — Context variable builder, upstream traversal, searchable dropdown. Has trigger lookup bug (line 55: looks for `outputSchema` instead of `payloadSchema`).
- `app/assets/js/controllers/workflow-config-panel.js` — Per-node-type config rendering. `_actionHTML()` (line 82) only renders action dropdown, no input field forms.
- `app/src/Services/WorkflowRegistry/WorkflowActionRegistry.php` — Static registry, `getForDesigner()` (line 177) already exposes `inputSchema`/`outputSchema`.
- `app/src/Controller/WorkflowsController.php` — `registry()` action (line 150) serves all 4 registries as JSON.
- `app/src/Services/WorkflowEngine/DefaultWorkflowEngine.php` — `executeActionNode()` (line 579) does `config.params` merge and stores result at `context['nodes'][$nodeId]['result']`.

📌 Full proposal: `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/mal-action-schema-architecture.md`

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Action Schema & Context Mapping — all 5 phases implemented and consolidated. Architecture (Mal), frontend fixes + field rendering (Wash commits 187032cf), backend schema + validation + enrichment (Kaylee commit 6c4528fb). 459 tests pass.

### 2026-02-11: Universal Value Picker Architecture

#### Architecture Decision
Designed a centralized "value picker" pattern for all workflow node parameters. Key decisions:

1. **Unified `resolveParamValue()` on backend** — single resolution method replacing the approval-specific `resolveRequiredCount()` logic. Handles plain scalars, `$.path` context shorthand, and `{type, value|path|key}` descriptor objects. `resolveRequiredCount()` becomes a thin int-casting wrapper around it.

2. **Three resolution types now, extensible later** — `fixed`, `context`, `app_setting` implemented. `entity_field` and `computed` reserved in the schema but not built (no real use case yet). Adding a new type is backward-compatible — just a new `case` in the switch.

3. **Frontend: `renderValuePicker()` on existing `WorkflowConfigPanel`** — not a separate file or Stimulus controller. A rendering helper that produces type-selector + dynamic-input HTML. Used by `_actionHTML`, `_conditionHTML`, `_approvalHTML`, `_delayHTML`, `_loopHTML`. Replaces Wash's `_requiredCountHTML()` (which was the prototype).

4. **Backward compatibility by design** — plain scalar values pass through unchanged. `$.path` strings auto-detected as context references. No workflow definition migration required. Old definitions work with new engine code.

5. **No new endpoints, no new files, no DB changes** — everything fits into existing structures. App settings API stays in `WorkflowsController`.

#### Key Patterns Discovered
- Wash's `_requiredCountHTML()` + `onRequiredCountTypeChange()` pattern is the exact right UX model — generalize it, don't replace it from scratch.
- `field` in condition nodes is a path REFERENCE (tells the condition where to look), NOT a value to resolve. Only `expectedValue` and `params.*` get value resolution.
- The variable picker (`WorkflowVariablePicker`) already handles context path computation correctly via reverse BFS. No changes needed there.
- `executeActionNode()` merges `config.params` into flat `config` (line 646-648) — param resolution must happen BEFORE this merge.

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Universal value picker fully implemented — Kaylee built `resolveParamValue()` backend, Wash built `renderValuePicker()` frontend. All 5 config panels refactored. 463 tests pass. Architecture executed as designed. — decided by Mal, Kaylee, Wash
📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Duplicate email fix — `activateApprovedRoster($sendNotifications)` pattern established for services wrapped by workflow notification steps. — decided by Kaylee
