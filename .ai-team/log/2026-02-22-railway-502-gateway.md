# Session Log: Railway 502 gateway validation consolidation

- **Date:** 2026-02-22
- **Requested by:** Josh Handel
- **Session manager:** Scribe

## Who worked
- **Josh Handel:** Requested session logging, decision consolidation, history propagation, and commit verification.
- **Jayne (Tester):** Supplied Railway 502 validation findings for likely port-binding mismatch and verification gates.
- **Scribe:** Logged the session, merged/deduped inbox decision content into canonical team decisions, propagated concise history update, and cleared merged inbox files.

## What changed
1. Added this session log at `.ai-team/log/2026-02-22-railway-502-gateway.md`.
2. Merged `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/jayne-railway-502-validation.md` into the consolidated 2026-02-22 Railway decision block in `.ai-team/decisions.md`.
3. Deduplicated by extending the existing consolidated Railway section instead of creating a duplicate dated decision block.
4. Added a concise propagated update to `.ai-team/agents/jayne/history.md`.
5. Cleared the merged inbox file from `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/`.

## Outcomes
- Canonical Railway guidance now includes 502 gateway/port-binding validation in one consolidated decision entry.
- Decision inbox is clear and ready for new submissions.
